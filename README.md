Small project with Google App Engine + Spring + Maven

We can find some projects on Internet with (Google App Engine + Spring MVC) or (Google App Engine + Maven),
but there is nearly no project created with the three technologies.

So I will try to create a small project with the three technologies above. The goal of this project is to allow my
friend who learns makeup to upload her works(pictures) which can be viewed by anyone.
